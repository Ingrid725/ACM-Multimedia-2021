<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>Recent deep learning methods rely on a large amount of labeled data to achieve high performance. These methods may be impractical in some scenarios, where manual data annotation is costly or the samples of certain categories are scarce (e.g., tumor lesions, endangered animals and rare individual activities). When only limited annotated samples are available, these methods usually suffer the overfitting problem severely, the performance usually degrades significantly. In contrast, humans can recognize the objects in the images rapidly and correctly with their prior knowledge after exposed to only a few annotated samples. To simulate the learning schema of humans and relieve the reliance on the large-scale annotation benchmarks, researchers start shifting towards the few-shot learning problem: they try to learn a model to correctly recognize novel categories with only a few annotated samples.</p>

<h3 id="course-description">Course description</h3>
<p>Substantial progress has been made in computer vision tasks. This attributes to large-scale datasets with precise annotations and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capable of absorbing the annotation information. However, annotating large-scale datasets with semantic masks is expensive, laborious, or even impractical, which violates the principle of cognitive learning where models should be constructed based on few supervisions. In practical applications, such as medical processing, it is usually difficult to collect annotated images since medical experts are usually quite busy but annotating medical images is time consuming. In this tutorial, we propose to introduce few-shot learning methods, which target at finding features that can generalize well to novel classes. With this tutorial, we give an overview about the recent progress in few-shot vision recognition, few-shot object detection, few-shot segmentation, few-shot medical image processing, and few-shot multi-modality tasks. It is expected that such a tutorial could inspire more cutting-edge methods in both the computer vision and multi-media areas in the near future.</p>

<h4 id="topic-1-few-shot-learning-fundamental-li-zhang">Topic 1. Few-shot Learning: Fundamental (Li Zhang)</h4>
<p>Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize target classes by adapting the prior knowledge learned from source classes. Such knowledge usually resides in a deep embedding model for a general matching purpose of the support and query image pairs. In this talk, I will first introduce a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework for few-shot learning, called the Relation Network (RN). It learns to learn a deep distance metric to compare a small number of images within episodes, each of which is designed to simulate the few-shot setting. Once trained, a RN is able to classify images of new classes by computing relation scores between query images and the few examples of each new class without further updating the network. Then we repurpose the contrastive learning with Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) for such matching to learn a few-shot embedding model in a supervised manner, exploiting the patch-wise relationship to substantially improve the popular infoNCE.</p>

<h4 id="topic-2-few-shot-learning-for-medical-image-processing-s-kevin-zhou">Topic 2. Few-shot Learning for Medical Image Processing (S. Kevin Zhou)</h4>
<p>Artificial intelligence or deep learning technologies have gained prevalence in solving medical imaging tasks. In this talk, we first review the traits that characterize medical images, such as multi-modalities, heterogeneous and isolated data, sparse and noisy labels, imbalanced samples. We then summarize some properties of deep learning technologies, including the paradigm shift from &ldquo;small task, big data&rdquo; to &ldquo;big task, small data&rdquo;. Finally, we illustrate the trends of AI technologies in medical imaging and present a multitude of algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Annotation-efficient methods</strong> that tackle medical image analysis without many labelled instances, including one-shot or label-free inference approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Universal models</strong> that learn âcommon + specificâ feature representations for multi-domain tasks to unleash the potential of âbigger dataâ, which are formed by integrating multiple datasets associated with tasks of interest into one use.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Deep learning + knowledge modeling&rdquo; approaches</strong>, which combine machine learning with domain knowledge to enable start-of-the-art performances for many tasks of medical image reconstruction, recognition, segmentation, and parsing.</li>

<h4 id="topic-3-few-shot-semantic-segmentation-qixiang-ye">Topic 3. Few-shot semantic segmentation (Qixiang ye)</h4>
<p>Few-shot semantic segmentation remains an open problem for the lack of effective method to handle the semantic misalignment between objects. In this talk, we introduce a part-based semantic transform (PST), and target at aligning object semantics in support images with those in query images by semantic decomposition-and-match. The semantic decomposition process is implemented with prototype mixture models (PMMs), which use an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to decompose object semantics into multiple prototypes corresponding to object parts. The semantic match between prototypes is performed with a min-cost flow module, which encourages correct correspondence while depressing mismatches between object parts. With semantic decomposition-and-match, PST enforces network&rsquo;s tolerance to objects' appearance and/or pose variation, and facilities channel-wised and spatial semantic activation of objects in query images. In the PST framework, we furhter propose anti-aliasing semantic reconstruction (ASR), provides a systematic yet interpretable solution for few-shot learning problems. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show that ASR achieves strong results compared with the prior works. (ECCV2020, CVPR2021, TNNLS2021, TIP-2020)</p>

<h4 id="topic-4-few-shot-incremental-learning-xiaopeng-hong">Topic 4. Few-shot Incremental Learning (Xiaopeng Hong)</h4>
<p>Recently, graph-based methods have achieved great success in the few-shot classification task by capturing the instance-level relations of samples. However, most of them ignore exploring the class-level knowledge that can be easily learned by humans from just a handful of samples. This talk introduces an Explicit Class Knowledge Propagation Network (ECKPN), which can explicitly learn the richer class knowledge to guide the graph-based inference of query samples. Meanwhile, this talk also discusses the challenges of applying few-shot learning in multimedia. (1) There is always a large modality gap between different modalities, which makes it difficult to learn effective multimodal features with only a few labeled samples. (2) Although there are already many successful few-shot learning methods in image classification, the multimodal few-shot learning is much more challenging due to the complexity of the multimodal data. To deal with these challenges, a two-stream graph network-based multimodal few-shot learning approach is presented in this talk.</p>

<h4 id="topic-5-few-shot-learning-for-multi-modality-tasks-xiaoshan-yang">Topic 5. Few-shot Learning for Multi-Modality Tasks (Xiaoshan Yang)</h4>
<p>The ability to incrementally learn new classes is crucial to the development of real-world artificial intelligence systems. We focus on a challenging but practical few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) problem. FSCIL requires CNN models to incrementally learn new classes from very few labelled samples, without forgetting the previously learned ones. To address this problem, we represent the knowledge using a neural gas (NG) network, which can learn and preserve the topology of the feature manifold formed by different classes. On this basis, we propose the TOpology-Preserving knowledge InCrementer (TOPIC) framework. TOPIC mitigates the forgetting of the old classes by stabilizing NG&rsquo;s topology and improves the representation learning for few-shot new classes by growing and adapting NG to new training samples. We further introduce the graph-based distillation approach into FSCIL and propose the exemplar relation distillation incremental learning framework to balance the tasks of old-knowledge preserving and new-knowledge adaptation. A large number of experiments show that our method substantially outperforms other CIL and FSCIL methods on CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CUB200 datasets.</p>

<h4 id="topic-6-few-shot-medical-image-segmentation-jie-chen">Topic 6. Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (Jie Chen)</h4>
<p>Few-shot learning is a typical scenario for medical image analysis. In medical domain, manual data annotation is very expensive and the samples of certain categories are scarce (e.g., tumor lesions). In this talk, we will focus on medical image segmentation, i.e., nuclear instance and polyp segmentation. For the nuclear instance segmentation, we propose a novel direction guided network (DGN). Specifically, we first define the direction feature to represent the spatial relationship between pixels. Based on direction feature, we propose a direction difference map (DDM) to reflect the direction difference of adjacent pixels and guide network to identify the instance boundary, especially the boundary of overlapping regions. Further, we propose a direction-guided refinement module, which effectively integrates auxiliary tasks and is used as a plug-and-play module to form the refining network for nuclear instance segmentation. For the polyp segmentation, we propose a Learnable Oriented-Derivative Network (LOD-Net) to refine the accuracy of boundary predictions for polyps. In particular, it firstly calculates eight oriented derivatives at each pixel for a polyp. It then selects those pixels with large oriented-derivative values to constitute a candidate border region of a polyp. It finally refines boundary prediction by fusing border region features and also those high-level semantic features calculated by a backbone network.</p>
